# TODO - Fix Ekstrakurikuler Edit Form Issues

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: HTML5 required attributes interfering with typing
**Problem:** The "jadwal latihan" and "pembina" fields had HTML5 `required` attributes that interfered with typing in the edit form.

**Solution:** Removed the `required` attributes from the HTML form fields while keeping server-side validation intact.

### Issue 2: Previous data not retained in edit form
**Problem:** When clicking edit, the previous data for pembina and jadwal latihan fields was not carried over, causing validation errors on update.

**Solution:** Changed the form field value logic from `old('field', $model->field)` to `old('field') ?: $model->field` to ensure model data is used when old input is empty.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Remove `required` attribute from jadwal_latihan input field in edit form
- [x] Remove `required` attribute from pembina input field in edit form
- [x] Keep red asterisk visual indicators for required fields
- [x] Fix form field population logic to retain previous data
- [x] Update all form fields (nama_ekskul, jadwal_latihan, pembina, tanggal, deskripsi) with correct value logic
- [x] Verify server-side validation still works

## Files Modified
- resources/views/operator/ekstrakurikulera/edit.blade.php

## Summary
Successfully fixed both issues with the ekstrakurikuler edit form:
1. Removed HTML5 required attributes to allow smooth typing experience
2. Fixed data retention logic to ensure previous data is properly populated in edit forms
Server-side validation remains intact in the controller, ensuring data integrity while providing a better user experience.
